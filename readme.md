## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```sh
make install
```

Then, run the development server:

```sh
make dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Now you can open `emails/index.tsx` and start editing the variable. 
The email will update as you edit the file.
Once you are happy with it, you can build it for production:

make build
```

This will create a `out` folder with the compiled email.
